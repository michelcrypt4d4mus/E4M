H1: Introduction

Welcome to the source distribution of E4M. This document briefly 
describes how to build E4M.

Firstly E4M does not use the build tool supplied by Microsoft in
the NT DDK.

E4M uses normal makefiles to build everything.

Extract the files from the zip archive, with "use directories" set
on. The source zip contains long names so don't use an older
pkunzip.

For the rest of this document I will assume you installed it 
into "C:\e4m", but this can be any directory. If you pick another
directory just replace "C:\e4m" in the documentation with 
whatever you like.

H1: What you will need

^ A compiler, which can be VC4.x, VC5.0, VC6.0 or later
+ The NT DDK

H1: Setup the DDK path

In the device drivers makefile, change the variable DDK to
the full path of your ddk directory, normally c:\ddk

H2: If you plan to debug the driver

If you plan to debug the product you will need:

^ Two computers and a serial cable (laplink cable)
+ The Win32 SDK, or WinDbg alone, which can be downloaded from Microsoft
+ The checked build of Widows NT installed on the second computer

H2: If you want to modify the help files

^ SDF {{URL:http://www.mincom.com/mtr/sdf/resources/index.html}}
+ any text editor
+ any Microsoft help compiler

H2: If you want to modify the setup program

^ InstallShield 5.0 professional or the "Free" Edition which 
   comes with Visual C++.
+ PackageForTheWeb which creates self extracting archives for distribution.

Note: The Debug format changed between VC4.x and VC5.0. To debug
  using VC5.0 or later you must download a new WinDbg from Microsoft.
  With an older VC4.x, try the WinDbg from an old Win32 SDK CD.

Enjoy,

H1: Verifying that you have genuine source code

Follow the instructions given in the E4M help file or in the online
documentation for verifying the main program.

H1: Building the driver 

^ open up a DOS prompt
+ change to the C: drive
+ cd to c:\e4m\ntdriver 
+ run "c:\progra~1\devstudio\vc\bin\vcvars32.bat" or "vcvars32 x86" 
   for VC4.x this sets up the search path's for your compiler
+ run "nmake" or "nmake RELEASE=1"

You should end up with e4mnt4.sys in the ntdriver directory.

H1: Setting up the registry entries for the driver

Don't try this by hand, just install the driver from the binary 
distribution, then overwrite it with the rebuilt driver.

H1: Building volmount, voltest etc

^ open up a DOS prompt
+ change to the C: drive
+ cd to c:\e4m\volmount, volformat etc
+ run "c:\progra~1\devstudio\vc\bin\vcvars32.bat" or "vcvars32 x86"
+ run "nmake" or "nmake RELEASE=1"
